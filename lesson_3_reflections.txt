When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When you want to share the work between multiple computers or multiple users

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    If I'm working on the same section of code as someone else, I wouldn't want
    their changes to conflict/break my code.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    A branch is a copy of the existing code in a repository that can be 
    developed and comimitted separately. A clone is a copy of another 
    repository. A fork is a clone on GitHub with a link back to the original
    repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    You will have the ability to merge the remote changes in the future but
    you can do the merge at a time that is convenient to you, even if you
    can't access the remote repository at that time.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Without GitHub, we would need to push and pull changes from the computers
    of each collaborator, or set up a server as a central repository. That 
    server wouldn't contain any of the GitHub-specific features.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
